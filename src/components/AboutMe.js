        <p>My name is Lattrell Sapon and I am an aspiring web developer. I have a passion in creating web sites. The fact that I can bring ideas into real life application is amazing. I enjoy starting new projects as they each bring their own unique problems. In web developing, I have learnt that I am always going to be learning no matter how much I know already and that is the challenge I am always up for.</p>
